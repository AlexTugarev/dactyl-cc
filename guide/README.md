I built this keyboard following the [Dactyl QMK Guide](https://www.joedevivo.com/2017/05/20/building-a-qmk-dactyl.html) by Joe Devivo.
 This is how I have built all of my Dactyl keyboards and allows me to build the firmware
 using the ErgodoxEZ online configurator which is now branded as [oryx](https://configure.ergodox-ez.com/).
The guide can also be found directly in the [dactyl github repo](https://github.com/adereth/dactyl-keyboard/tree/master/qmk-guide).

The most important parts of the guide are the following two images which you will refer to quite often:
